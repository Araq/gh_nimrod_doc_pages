gh_nimrod_doc_pages quick readme
================================

Thank you for trying the binary package of `gh_nimrod_doc_pages
<https://github.com/gradha/gh_nimrod_doc_pages>`_!  This binary package
contains only this brief welcome, the `usage manual
<gh_nimrod_doc_pages_usage.html>`_ (`see online
<http://gradha.github.io/gh_nimrod_doc_pages/gh_docs/master/docs/gh_nimrod_doc_pages_usage.html>`_)
and the binaries.

The file ``gh_nimrod_doc_pages`` is a statically compiled binary which should
work on your platform without further dependencies. There is no explicit
installation, you can simply run the program and it should work (but don't
forget about the external programs mentioned in the `usage manual
<gh_nimrod_doc_pages_usage.html>`_).  If you like it you can of course put it
somewhere in your ``$PATH`` or create a shortcut/alias to it so that you don't
have to type too much to run it.

If something doesn't work, you can drop me a note at
https://github.com/gradha/gh_nimrod_doc_pages/issues. The file
``gh_nimrod_doc_pagesd`` is the same binary compiled in debug mode so you can
report stack traces in case of a crash. Good luck!
